In this project, I learned how to use AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) to control who can do what in AWS. IAM is very important because it helps keep AWS accounts secure by managing users, groups, roles, and permissions. Here’s what I did and learned: Created IAM Users: Made individual users who can log in or use AWS services. Each user can have passwords or access keys. Made User Groups: Put users into groups so it’s easier to manage permissions for many users at once. Created Custom Policies: Wrote my own permission rules in JSON format to allow only certain actions, not full access. This helps keep things safe by giving just enough permission. Attached Policies to Groups: Gave the whole group the custom permissions by attaching policies to groups, so all members get those permissions automatically. Learned About Roles: Found out roles are like special permission sets that AWS services or users can assume temporarily without long-term keys. This is useful for things like EC2 or cross-account access. Saw How Permissions Work: Understood how AWS decides if someone can do something by checking all the policies attached to them. Security Tips: Learned to use MFA, rotate keys, and avoid using the root account for daily work to keep accounts safe.
